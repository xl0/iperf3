Current list of things to fix/add to iperf3

-  readd -Z option (linux tcp congestion control algoritm)
-  readd flag to set IP_TOS (-S)
-  add debug options and extend verbose mode
-  separate iperf_api.c into iperf_client.c and iperf_utils.c
-  add more iperf API support and documentation 
-  look for 'XXX' in code and address
-  better packaging/makefile, README, LICENCE, etc files
-  document and verify the 'state machine'. Is it an error to send messages in the wrong order?
     - e.g.: what is "STREAM_RUNNING" vs "TEST_RUNNING"??
-  add human readable vs machine readable output mode
     (my idea on this is that "human readable" = compatable with old iperf,
     and that "machine readable is all name=value pairs -blt )
-  add IPV6
-  lots more testing
-  add daemon mode (-D)
-  see issue tracker for other wish list items
