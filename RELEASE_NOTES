  * Better error handling
      * All errors now handled with iperf_error()
      * All functions that can return errors return NULL or -1 on error and set i_errno appropriately
  * Iperf API intruduced
      * Support for adding new protocols
      * Added support for callback functions
          * on_connect - executes after a connection is made to the server
          * on_new_stream - executes after a new stream is created
          * on_test_start - executes right before the test begins
          * on_test_finish - executes after the test is finished

  * UDP mode now supported
      * Support for setting bandwidth (-b)
      * Parallel UDP stream support
      * Reverse mode UDP support
  * Support for setting TCP_NODELAY (-N), disabling Nagle's Algorithm
  * Support for setting TCP MSS (-M)
      * Note: This feature is still in development. It is still very buggy.

  * TCP control socket now manages messages between client and server
  * Dynamic server (gets test parameters from client)
      * Server can now set test options dynamically without having to restart.
          * Currently supported options: -l, -t, -n, -P, -R
          * Future options: -u, -b, -w, -M, -N, -I, -T, -Z, -6
  * Results exchange
      * Client can now see server results (and vice versa)
  * Reverse mode (-R)
      * Server sends, client receives
